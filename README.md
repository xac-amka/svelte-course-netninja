## [1] What is Svelte?
 - Compiler for creating **reactive** web apps & interfaces
 - Can be used for small parts of a site, or entirely (SPA)

## [2] Comparint to other frameworks
 - Svelte is a **compiler**, but not a framework
 - Svelte compiles your code for production at build time into a single, vanilla, JS bundle
 - No extra scripts or libraries are shipped to production
 - Often results in a faster running website
 
## [3] To install
```js
npm i -g degit
degit sveltejs/template <your_app_name>
```
